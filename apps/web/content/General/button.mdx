# Button

To trigger an operation.

## When To Use

A button means an operation (or a series of operations). Clicking a button will trigger its corresponding business logic.

In Hotdog-Ui we provide 6 types of button.

- 🔵 Primary button: used for the main action, there can be at most one primary button in a section.
- ⚪️ Ghost button: used for a series of actions without priority.
- 🔳 Outlined button: used for actions with a clear boundary.
- 😶 Dashed button: commonly used for adding more actions.
- 🔤 Text button: used for the most secondary action.
- 🔗 Link button: used for external links.

And we provide 2 animations for buttons.

- 🏃‍♂️ Ripple: creates a wave effect on click.
- 🏃‍♀️ Pulse: makes the button grow and shrink continuously.

Colors are also customizable, you can choose from:

<Colors />
